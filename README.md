# JavaScript Book System

This is a simple Book Management System implemented entirely using vanilla JavaScript. It demonstrates core JavaScript features such as functions, arrow functions, object literals, prompt input, loops, conditions, and built-in string methods.

## Features

- Add a new book using `prompt()`
- Display all books in the console
- Search for books by title (case-insensitive)
- View the total number of books and a library size message
- Get the category of a book based on publication year
- Demonstrates usage of:
  - Functions and arrow functions
  - JavaScript object literals
  - Hoisting
  - Loops (`for`)
  - Conditional statements (`if`, nested `if`, `switch`, ternary operator)
  - Data types: string, number, boolean, null, undefined
  - Comparison and logical operators
  - Built-in string methods: `toUpperCase`, `toLowerCase`, `length`, `indexOf`, `charCodeAt`
  - Console output: `console.log`, `console.error`, `console.warn`
  - `alert()` and `prompt()` for interaction

## How to Run

1. Open the `day12p/index.html` file in any web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox).
2. Open the browser's **Developer Tools** (F12 or right-click → Inspect → Console).
3. All output from the script will appear in the **Console tab**.
4. Follow the `prompt()` dialogs to add books and interact with the system.

## Notes

- The system runs entirely in the browser, with no external libraries or frameworks.
- It was built under specific constraints for learning purposes.
